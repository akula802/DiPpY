# DiPpY
A 2-D dip calculator for geosteering horizontal wells.

Uses the tkinter library to provide a GUI. Originally written in Python 2.7, tested okay on Python 3.4 -
see the comments in the "import" section to switch between Python versions. This is the first app I ever 
created with Python, so please excuse the sloppy code. I will fix this at some point.
